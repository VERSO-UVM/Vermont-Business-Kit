# Vermont Small Business Resource Platform

Welcome to the **Vermont Small Business Resource Platform** — a collaborative initiative to transform how entrepreneurs in Vermont discover, access, and engage with business support services. Whether you're launching a startup or expanding your business, this platform connects you with the tools, organizations, and funding opportunities you need to thrive.

## What Is the Platform?

Led by the [Women+ Small Business Owner Collaborative](#project-partners), this platform combines:

- **[The Kit (Annual Guide)](#the-kit-annual-publication)** – a beautifully designed print + digital resource guide
- **[Interactive Website](#interactive-website)** – a real-time, searchable, multilingual digital directory
- **[AI-Powered Platform](#ai-powered-platform)** – a smart chatbot to guide entrepreneurs to the right services

Together, these components are designed to improve access to Vermont-based resources, especially for historically excluded communities.
