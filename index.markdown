# Vermont Business Kit

## About the Project

The **Vermont Business Kit** is an open-source platform supporting the **Vermont Small Business Resource Platform** — a statewide initiative to transform how entrepreneurs discover, access, and engage with business support services.

Led by the **Women+ Small Business Owner Collaborative**, this platform combines an annual printed resource guide ("The Kit"), an interactive digital directory, and AI-powered tools to help Vermont’s small businesses thrive. Together, these components aim to improve accessibility, foster collaboration, and address barriers faced by historically excluded entrepreneurs.

---

## Project Background

In 2024, eight Vermont business service organizations formed a coalition to co-create a centralized and inclusive business support platform. A discovery workshop with **Game Theory** (creators of *This Way Up*) helped define a vision for a hybrid resource system that pairs storytelling with utility. 

This led to:
- **The Kit** – a printed/digital magazine that showcases support organizations and success stories.
- **An AI-powered chatbot** – to help entrepreneurs navigate resources more easily and equitably.
- **A digital platform** – that allows ongoing updates, multilingual access, and community ownership.

Initial research and testimony presented to the **VT Senate Economic Development Committee** helped initiate next steps, in collaboration with the **Leahy Institute for Rural Partnerships** and other statewide stakeholders.

- Develop an **interactive, multilingual, and searchable digital directory**
- Launch an **AI-powered assistant** for personalized resource navigation
