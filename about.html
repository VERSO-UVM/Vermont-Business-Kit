      <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
      <p>
        Small businesses are the backbone of Vermont’s economy, but many entrepreneurs struggle
        to find clear, up-to-date information on what’s required to start or run a business.
        This platform brings those answers together, in plain language, with links to the people
        and tools that can help you grow your business sustainably and successfully.
